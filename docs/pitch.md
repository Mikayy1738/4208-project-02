# Pitch
**Track:** Productivitya and Analytics hybrid
**Product BodyIQ:** BodyIQ is an all in one fitness tracking application. It tracks users weight, macros, and workout history. 
**Problem & User:** Most serious fitness enthusiasts track metrics like weight, macronutrients, and workout history often across multiple apps. BodyIQ brings all these metrics together in a single application, leveraging the data to give users a clear assessment of their current fitness status. Unlike other apps that track only one or two metrics, BodyIQ consolidates everything, providing a complete picture of progress over time. By visualizing past data through graphs and analytics, users can better understand trends, identify what works, and optimize their fitness journey.
**Core Loop:** User Action: The user inputs dataâ€”such as logging a workout, recording their weight, or entering macronutrient information. State Change: The app updates its internal database with the new information, recalculating relevant metrics like total calories consumed, workout intensity, or weight progress. Render: The app's interface refreshes to display updated statistics, progress graphs, and any new insights derived from the latest data. Outcome: The user gains a clearer understanding of their fitness journey, with visual representations of their progress, motivating them to continue their efforts.
