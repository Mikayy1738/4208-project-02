# Roadmap 
## MVP (Sprint 2) 
- Weight tracker
- Macro tracker
- Workout tracker
 
## Full (Sprint 3) 
- User data interaction for progress assessment
- Progress prediction

## Risks & Mitigations (Top 3) 
1) Users relying on the app to assess health problems -> Add a disclaimer that the reccomendations given are based off of mathmatical formulas and to seek a professional.
2) If API goes down certain features will not work (Macro tracking) -> Have a locally stored generic values (In case of Macros) for popular food items.  
3) User data getting scrapped. (email) -> obfuscate user data.
